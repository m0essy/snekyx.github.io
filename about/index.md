Hi

my name is Gerhard Schneckenleitner, and I am a software developer living in Vienna (Austria).

I'm passionate about functional programming, big data and solving software puzzles.

In my free time, when I'm not hacking some scala or haskell code I like to climb, and ride the unicycle.

### More Information
Believe it or not I am also interested in studying the law. Especially about security, privacy, software licenses and the laws around the IoT.
