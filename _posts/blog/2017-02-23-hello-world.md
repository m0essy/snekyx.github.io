# Hello world... again

### Wow...

### BAAAMMMM...

### Done... really fast

Finally I relaunched my blog. After Years (really) of neglecting my old blog, posting something now and then I relaunched it with [Jekyll](jekyll).

I tried joomla and wordpress before, but it never felt quite comfortable to write and manage blogs.

Then I got to know [Jekyll](jekyll). I really appreciate the lack of server side components and the absence of a database.

Let's hope I can get more blog articles done with [Jekyll](jekyll). But for now I am really excited to have such a simple plattform.


Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
